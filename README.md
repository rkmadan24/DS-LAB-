## 📂 List of Programs

1️. **Stack using Array** – Implements push, pop and display operations with handling of stack overflow and underflow. 

2️. **Infix to Postfix Conversion** – Converts a valid parenthesized infix expression into postfix form using stack operations.  

3 a. **Queue using Array** – Simulates insert, delete and display operations of a linear queue with overflow and underflow handling.  

3 b. **Circular Queue using Array** – Implements insert, delete and display operations using circular queue logic for efficient memory usage. 

4. **Singly Linked List (Insertion)** – Creates a linked list and inserts nodes at the beginning, specific position and end of the list. 

5. **Singly Linked List (Deletion)** – Deletes first, specified and last nodes from a singly linked list and displays the list. 

6 a. **Singly Linked List (Advanced Operations)** – Performs sorting, reversing, concatenation of linked lists and simulates stack and queue operations.   

6 b. **Singly Linked List (Stack & Queue Operations)** - Performs Stack & Queue Operations by implementing Singly Linked List.

7. **Doubly Linked List** – Implements creation, insertion to the left of a node, deletion based on value and display of a doubly linked list.  

8. **Binary Search Tree** – Constructs a BST and performs inorder, preorder and postorder traversals to display elements. 

9a & 9b. **Graph Traversal (BFS & DFS)** – Traverses a graph using BFS and checks whether the graph is connected using DFS traversal. 

1️0. **Hashing with Linear Probing** – Maps employee keys to hash table addresses using remainder method and resolves collisions using linear probing.
